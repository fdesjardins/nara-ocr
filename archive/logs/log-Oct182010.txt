        Researching larger handwritten character recognition data sets. The two large databases seem to be the Cedar USPS database of cities, states, zip codes, etc, and the MNIST database of upper-case characters. Both of these databases seem to be available at cost, only. 
 
RIMES also appears to be a well known database for character recognition tasks.
