This folder contains the database of characters that were generated using a jitter script, and a stitching script.
Also, tesseract training was performed in this folder. So, the scattered files are from that process. 

count_chars.py: 

simply counts the number of characters in a file, excluding spaces.
usage: "python count_chars.py wordlist"



dict_stitch.py: 

the keystone of the training images generation. Takes a wordlist, and fetches a random character from
                one of the folders (char_A/A/) for each character of the wordlist. It builds a single image containing these
                constructed words, for use with training tesseract.
usage: "python dict_stitch.py wordlist"



jitter.py: 

jitters 1 or many input images, and places the jittered output images into the same directory as the input image[s].
usage: "python jitter.py char_A/A_0.png"



jitter_all.py: 

runs jitter.py over all of the images in current directory
usage: "python jitter_all.py"



train.py: 

uses BASH commands to either make a box file from a tif image, or train from a box file and tif image
usage: "train.py [inputImg] -makebox" 
       OR 
       "train.py [inputImg]"



utils.py: 

contains some general use functions.
usage: "from utils import *"
