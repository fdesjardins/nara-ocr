Each folder contains the results of running tesseract and OCRopus
over the assembly image the folder is named after.

Currently, this is using a standard un-trained scan with OCRopus,
an un-trained scan with tesseract, and then a post-trained scan with tesseract.

The training was done using the characters from that image.
(i.e., tesseract.cus.out.txt for 6201019-01 is the result 
of training using characters from image 6201919-01.tif ONLY)

There is one exception in 6201018-02, where I used the training from the 
larger dataset (6201019-01, over 3,000 chars) to do the recognition.
